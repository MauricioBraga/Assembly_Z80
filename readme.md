## Z80 Assembly source code examples

Here you will find small examples of assembly code I wrote for teaching ASM in my computer architecture classes.

The source code you will find here is in z80 assembly language, and is meant to be run on a MSX computer. It is possible to convert them to run in other z80 machines, if you are brave enough. :)

Since most of this code was meant as teaching examples for my classes, the comments will be written in portuguese. Sorry, I don't have time to translate them, but any good web translator will allow you to understand what is written.

These examples can be compiled using PASMO, a really good assembly compiler. Most of them can also be executed using the MSX environment available at msxpen.com

Have fun!
